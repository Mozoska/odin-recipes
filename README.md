# The Odin Project: Foundations - Lasagna Recipe

## Project Description

This project is part of the "Foundations" curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It serves as a practical exercise for creating a static web page to display a recipe. The primary goal is to solidify basic HTML knowledge, including the use of headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and image embedding.

* Displays a complete recipe with ingredients and instructions.
* Semantic use of HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<img>`, etc.).
