    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) lean beef (flank, top round, or bottom round), thinly sliced (about 3-5 mm or 1/8-1/4 inch thick)</li>
        <li>125 ml (about 1/2 cup) soy sauce (low sodium preferred)</li>
        <li>60 ml (about 1/4 cup) Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>60 ml (about 1/4 cup) teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Marinating Time:</strong> 6-24 hours</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 4-8 hours</p>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> Varies</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat:</strong> Slice the beef thinly. Slice with the grain for tougher, chewier jerky, or against the grain for more tender jerky.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper (if desired), and liquid smoke (if desired).</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> Place the beef slices into a large resealable bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the beef, ensuring each piece is well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, ideally 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for Drying:</strong> Remove the beef from the marinade and drain any excess liquid. Pat the beef dry thoroughly with paper towels. This step is crucial for proper drying.</li>
        <li><strong>Oven Drying Method:</strong> Preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature (ideally 70-80째C / 160-175째F). Arrange the beef slices in a single layer on wire racks placed over baking sheets, ensuring they don't overlap. Leave the oven door slightly ajar to allow moisture to escape. Dry for 4 to 8 hours, or until the jerky is dry but still pliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Dehydrator Method:</strong> Follow your dehydrator's instructions. Typically, the temperature is set between 60-70째C (140-160째F) for 4-8 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling and Storage:</strong> Let the jerky cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For more intense flavor, add spices like ground ginger, coriander, or red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Liquid smoke provides a smoky flavor without needing a smoker.</li>
        <li>Drying time varies depending on the thickness of the beef slices and your oven or dehydrator.</li>
    </ul>
