        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Béchamel Sauce:</h4>

        <li>80 g (about 1/3 cup) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>80 g (about 2/3 cup) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 liter (about 4 cups) whole milk, preferably warm</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and white (or black) pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Assembly:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>250-300 g (about 1/2 to 3/4 lb) fresh or dry lasagna noodles (if dry, pre-cook according to package instructions, unless they are "no-boil")</li>
        <li>200 g (about 2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese (or a mozzarella-provolone blend)</li>
        <li>100 g (about 1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan cheese (and a little extra for topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <h4>1. Prepare the Bolognese Sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and celery, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ground meat. Brown the meat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and mix well.</li>
        <li>Deglaze with the red wine (if using) and let it reduce by half, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer over low heat for at least 30 minutes (ideally 1 hour or more to develop flavors), stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken. Remove bay leaves before assembling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2. Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the flour all at once and whisk continuously for 1 to 2 minutes to form a roux. Do not let the roux brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat. Gradually whisk in the warm milk constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>Return the saucepan to medium heat and continue whisking constantly until the sauce thickens and reaches the desired consistency (it should coat the back of a spoon). This takes about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3. Assemble the Lasagna:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F).</li>
        <li>In a large rectangular baking dish (about 23x33 cm / 9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the béchamel, overlapping slightly if necessary. If using dry pasta, ensure they are soft enough or pre-cooked.</li>
        <li>Spread an even layer of Bolognese sauce over the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cover with a layer of béchamel.</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle with mozzarella and a little Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: pasta, Bolognese, béchamel, cheeses, until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of pasta covered with a generous layer of béchamel and a good amount of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>4. Baking:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the aluminum foil and continue baking for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the lasagna is golden brown and bubbling around the edges.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and prevents it from falling apart.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chef's Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For a richer sauce:</strong> Add a splash of milk to the Bolognese at the end of cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh vs. Dry Pasta:</strong> Fresh pasta gives a more tender texture. If using "no-boil" dry pasta, ensure your sauce is moist enough to hydrate them during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Feel free to vary the cheeses! Ricotta can be added in small dollops over the sauce layers for a creamier lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Lasagna is an ideal make-ahead dish. You can assemble it entirely and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking, or freeze it raw or cooked. If baking from frozen, increase the cooking time.</li>
