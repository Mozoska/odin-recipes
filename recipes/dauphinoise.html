        <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 6-8 people</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1.5 kg (about 3.3 lbs) starchy potatoes (like Russet or Yukon Gold), peeled and thinly sliced (about 2-3 mm thick)</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated</li>
            <li>500 ml (about 2 cups) heavy cream (35% fat)</li>
            <li>250 ml (about 1 cup) whole milk</li>
            <li>100 g (about 1 cup) Gruyère cheese, grated (or Comté, or a good quality cheddar)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, picked (or 1 tsp dried thyme)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for greasing the dish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <h4>1. Prepare the Potatoes and Cream Mixture:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 180°C (350°F).</li>
            <li><strong>Grease a large gratin dish</strong> (approximately 25x35 cm or 10x14 inches) generously with butter.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the **heavy cream**, **whole milk**, **minced garlic**, **thyme leaves**, **nutmeg**, **salt**, and **pepper**. Whisk well to combine. Taste the mixture and adjust seasoning as needed – remember the potatoes will absorb a lot of the flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the **thinly sliced potatoes** to the cream mixture and toss gently to ensure all potato slices are coated.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>2. Assemble the Dauphinoise:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange about **half of the potato slices** in a single, even layer in the prepared gratin dish. Try to overlap them slightly for a nice presentation.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle about **half of the grated Gruyère cheese** evenly over the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour about **half of the remaining cream mixture** over this layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the **remaining potato slices**, arranging them in a second layer.</li>
            <li>Pour the **rest of the cream mixture** evenly over the second layer of potatoes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the **remaining Gruyère cheese** over the top.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>3. Bake the Dauphinoise Potatoes:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the gratin dish on a baking sheet (to catch any potential overflow).</li>
            <li><strong>Bake for 45 to 60 minutes</strong>, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, and the top is beautifully golden brown and bubbly. If the top browns too quickly, you can loosely cover it with aluminum foil for the last 15-20 minutes of baking.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it **rest for 10-15 minutes** before serving. This allows the creamy sauce to set and makes for easier serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Chef's Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slicing is key:</strong> For best results, use a mandoline to get perfectly even, thin slices of potato. This ensures even cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't rinse the potatoes:</strong> Unlike some potato dishes, do not rinse the sliced potatoes. The starch helps to thicken the sauce naturally.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese variations:</strong> While Gruyère is traditional, you can also use Comté, Emmental, or even a good quality sharp cheddar for a different flavor profile. Some recipes even skip the cheese entirely in the layers, only adding it on top or not at all, to keep it truly "gratin dauphinois" (without cheese).</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic infusion:</strong> For a more subtle garlic flavor, you can rub the inside of the baking dish with a cut garlic clove before buttering.</li>
            <li><strong>Resting time:</strong> Don't skip the resting time! It's crucial for the sauce to set and prevents the potatoes from falling apart when served.</li>
        </ul>
